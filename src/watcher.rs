//! The polling thread: samples the cursor, feeds [`crate::trigger`], and runs
//! whatever it says to run.
//!
//! The decision logic lives in `trigger`; the Win32 questions live in
//! `desktop`. What is left here is the loop and its three timers.
//!
//! # Why polling rather than a mouse hook
//!
//! The obvious alternative is a `WH_MOUSE_LL` low-level hook. We deliberately
//! do not use one:
//!
//!   * A low-level hook runs *inline* on the input thread for every mouse
//!     move system-wide. Any latency we add is latency the whole desktop
//!     feels, and if our callback overruns `LowLevelHooksTimeout` Windows
//!     silently unhooks us — the app appears to just stop working.
//!   * Hooks need a pumped message loop on the installing thread, coupling
//!     detection to UI responsiveness.
//!
//! `GetCursorPos` at ~33 Hz costs a few hundred nanoseconds per tick, is
//! immune to both problems, and a hot corner does not need sub-30 ms
//! resolution when it is gated behind a 250 ms dwell anyway.
