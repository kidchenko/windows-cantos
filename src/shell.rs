//! Ask Explorer to do things, rather than faking the keystrokes a user would
//! press to do them.
//!
//! This is the difference between an action that works and one that silently
//! does nothing. Synthetic input aimed at a window owned by a higher
//! integrity process is discarded by Windows without an error — so with a
//! terminal or Task Manager running as administrator in the foreground,
//! `SendInput` is simply thrown away.
//!
//! Shell automation is not input. `Shell.Application` is a COM server hosted
//! by Explorer, which runs at medium integrity like we do, and a posted
//! message to the taskbar goes to Explorer's window rather than to whatever
//! happens to have focus. Neither cares what is in the foreground, so neither
//! is affected. Measured, with an elevated window focused:
//!
//! ```text
//! SendInput Win+Tab              discarded
//! IShellDispatch5::WindowSwitcher  worked
//! IShellDispatch4::ToggleDesktop   worked
//! PostMessage(tray, SC_TASKLIST)   worked
//! ms-settings: URI                 worked
//! ```
//!
//! Every one of these returns a bool so the caller can fall back to a
//! keystroke when no shell equivalent exists or the call fails.
