//! When does a corner fire?
//!
//! This is the part that decides whether the app feels solid or twitchy, so it
//! lives on its own and does nothing else. It holds no Win32 handles, touches
//! no config mutex, and runs no actions — it is fed a hot spot and the current
//! settings once per tick and answers "fire this corner" or "not yet".
//!
//! # The rules
//!
//! * **Dwell.** Resting in a corner for `dwell_ms` arms it. Without this,
//!   overshooting toward a window's Close button fires the corner every time.
//! * **Cooldown *and* leaving.** After firing, a spot stays disarmed until
//!   both the cooldown elapses and the cursor leaves. Both, not either —
//!   otherwise parking the mouse would repeat the action.
//! * **Vetoes.** A completed dwell can still be refused; see [`Veto`] for the
//!   two very different ways that plays out.
//!
//! A "spot" rather than a corner: in `EveryMonitor` mode every display has its
//! own top-left, and they must not be confused with each other. See
//! [`crate::geometry::Spot`].
